# Generate your own QR code

## Overview

A **QR code generator** is a tool that converts text, URLs, files (via share links), and other payloads into a machine-readable 2D barcode which smartphones and scanners can decode. Your tool is a client-side, browser-first QR generator that supports multiple content types, allows logo overlays, provides a visual preview, and offers PNG downloads. It uses two popular JavaScript QR libraries with a CDN fallback strategy to improve reliability.

This article explains the background of QR codes, how and when to use a generator like this, code-level behavior and examples for each content type, and the kinds of technologies and real-world workflows that commonly rely on QR code generation.

## History

QR (Quick Response) codes were invented in 1994 by Denso Wave (a Toyota subsidiary) as a faster alternative to traditional barcodes. QR codes encode data in two dimensions allowing much higher capacity — numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji — and are designed to be read quickly by imaging devices.

Over the years QR codes moved from industrial use to consumer-facing applications: URL redirects, product labels, two-factor authentication (TOTP seed provisioning), event tickets, contact cards (vCard), payment links, Wi‑Fi credentials, and more. The open ecosystem around QR led to many client-side libraries (like the ones used in your code) that can render QR codes on `<canvas>` or as images for web apps.

## Usage

### What your generator does

-   Accepts multiple content types: **Website**, **Text**, **PDF**, **Images**, **Video** (the latter three via share links from Google Drive/Dropbox/etc.).
    
-   Provides a selection of logos to overlay at the center of the QR code for branding.
    
-   Uses a progressive library fallback: primary `qrcode` package (cdn.jsdelivr) and fallback `qrcodejs` (cdnjs) if needed.
    
-   Renders to a preview area and offers a **Download** action which converts the canvas to a PNG blob.
    
-   Attempts to auto-generate a default QR on page load and pre-selects WhatsApp logo for UX.
    

### When to use a client-side generator

-   Quick one-off QR codes for events, business cards, or product labels without needing a backend.
    
-   Tools embedded directly into marketing or admin dashboards where privacy matters (data never leaves the browser).
    
-   Prototyping and offline/air-gapped demos.
    

### When to avoid pure client-side only approaches

-   When you need audit logs, server-side analytics, or persistent short URLs — combine QR with a backend redirect service.
    
-   Large-scale batch generation (thousands of codes) — better to generate on the server and stream/save files.

## Examples for all types (how the UI maps to payloads)

> The UI exposes five content types. Below are sample payloads and tips for each.

### 1) Website

-   **Payload**: full URL (e.g., `https://example.com/landing-page`)
    
-   **Notes**: Always include `https://` to avoid mis-parsing. For marketing use, consider using a short redirect URL that tracks scans.
    

### 2) Text

-   **Payload**: arbitrary text (e.g., `Hello — visit our store at 10am`)
    
-   **Notes**: Ideal for short instructions; long text will still encode but may increase QR complexity (denser pattern) and reduce readability.
    

### 3) PDF (file link)

-   **Payload**: a sharing URL from Google Drive / Dropbox / S3 signed URL.
    
-   **Notes**: Use file-hosted URLs that grant read access without login for best scanner experience. Prefer short links or redirectors to keep QR complexity lower.
    

### 4) Images

-   **Payload**: direct image sharing link (Google Drive direct-share, Dropbox direct-link, or CDN URL).
    
-   **Notes**: Ensure the link points to an image resource; if using Drive, use the `uc?export=view&id=` direct link variant for immediate image access.
    

### 5) Video

-   **Payload**: share link to hosted video (YouTube/vimeo or cloud storage share link).
    
-   **Notes**: Hosted video pages (YouTube) are ideal because they render in browser after scanning. Signed cloud links should be used for private videos.
